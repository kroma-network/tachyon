  // - Use FLAG_WIN_SHARE_DELETE when creating/opening a file to allow another

  //   Note that it's possible for deletion to be cancelled via another File
  //   object referencing the same file using DeleteOnClose(false) to clear the
  //   DeleteFile disposition after the original File is closed.
  // - Use FLAG_CAN_DELETE_ON_CLOSE in conjunction with DeleteOnClose() to alter
  //   the DeleteFile disposition on an open handle. This fine-grained control
  //   allows for marking a file for deletion during processing so that it is
  //   deleted in the event of untimely process termination, and then clearing
  //   this state once the file is suitable for persistence.
