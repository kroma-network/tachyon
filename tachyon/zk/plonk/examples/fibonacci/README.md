# Fibonacci Circuits Test

## Acknowledgements

The three circuits and single chip originally come from the [halo2-examples](https://github.com/icemelon/halo2-examples/tree/6b8676487635169367e085a44e3b73c56290883f/src/fibonacci) repository by [icemelon](https://github.com/icemelon), demonstrating four different circuit designs for the Fibonacci sequence. `example4.rs` had not been implemented as it requires a larger evaluation domain for testing.
